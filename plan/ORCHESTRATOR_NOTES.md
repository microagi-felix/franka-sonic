# Orchestrator notes for the running phase agent (P5)

Echoed by every `harness/bakeoff.py` call. Newest first. Act on them; log what you did in STATUS.md.

## 2026-09-03 16:10 UTC — all 8 GPUs are allocatable now; use them

- `harness/gpus.py` threshold raised 1 → 40 GiB (pulled onto the pod). Devices 0–4 and 6 hold
  5–19 GiB from processes outside this pod that are idle (measured ~380 TFLOPS bf16 on each,
  identical memory numbers since 2026-09-01). Felix: "don't we have 8 on 1 instance" — yes, use them.
- **Do now, in this order:**
  1. Run the export → replay loop (WP 5.2) on a free device immediately for the newest jp3 and jp5
     checkpoints instead of waiting for the caps; keep doing it every ~30 min.
  2. Launch up to **4 more warm-started variants in parallel** (`--checkpoint` the best jp3/jp5
     `model_step` so far, `--num-envs 4096 --hours 2.5`), one per device, each its own yaml:
     - jp6: jp5 + `algo.config.actor.backbone.aux_loss_coef.g1_recon` 0.01 → 1.0 (the token must
       carry the reference joints; the recon target includes joint pos/vel)
     - jp7: jp5 + `std_clamp_max` 0.5 → 1.5 and `max_grad_norm` 0.1 → 1.0 (exploration for 3 rad
       excursions is otherwise ~0.1 rad)
     - jp8: jp6 + jp7 together
     - jp9: jp8 on a motion library WITHOUT the mirrored clips (keep the augmentations) — see the
       mirror check in P5.md §6 item 3; skip jp9 if the mirror check passes
     Keep at least ONE device free for export/replay/label/oracle at all times. Mind the CPU: if
     iteration time on the existing runs doubles after the launches, stop the newest variant by
     its recorded pgid.
  3. At each cap: export + replay every variant, run `label_tokens` + `oracle_b` on the best one
     (lowest replay error), then the next best if it scores ≥ 10/20 but < 15/20.
- STATUS.md stays append-only and yours; the orchestrator writes only this file and P5.md.
